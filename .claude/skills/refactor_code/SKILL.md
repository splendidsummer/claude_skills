# Skill: Refactor Code

Refactor code for better design, readability, and maintainability.

## Steps
1. Identify the target code to refactor (from user input or code smells).
2. Analyze current code structure and identify issues:
   - Code duplication
   - Long functions/methods
   - Poor naming conventions
   - Tight coupling
   - Missing abstractions
3. Propose a refactoring plan before making changes.
4. Apply refactoring incrementally, preserving existing behavior.
5. Run tests after each refactoring step to ensure no regressions.
6. Do NOT change external APIs or behavior unless explicitly requested.

## Output format
- Code smells identified
- Refactoring plan (before/after summary)
- Files modified
- Tests passed confirmation
