# Explain Code

Provide deep code explanation and architecture walkthrough.

## Steps
1. Identify the target code (file, module, function, or entire project).
2. Analyze the code structure and flow:
   - Entry points and execution flow
   - Data flow and transformations
   - Dependencies and interactions between modules
   - Design patterns used
3. Explain at the appropriate level of detail:
   - High-level architecture overview
   - Module responsibilities
   - Key algorithms and logic
   - Important design decisions
4. Use diagrams or ASCII art when helpful.
5. Highlight any non-obvious behavior or gotchas.

## Output format
- Architecture overview
- Module/function breakdown
- Data flow description
- Key design patterns identified
- Potential areas of complexity or concern
