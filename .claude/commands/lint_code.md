# Lint Code

Run linting tools to check code quality.

## Steps
1. Check for linting configuration (pyproject.toml, .flake8, etc.).
2. Run appropriate linters (ruff, flake8, mypy, etc.).
3. Report any linting issues found.
4. Do NOT auto-fix issues without user approval.

## Output format
- List of linting tools run
- Summary of issues found (if any)
- Severity levels (error, warning, info)
