# Implement Feature

Implement a new feature with proper structure and tests.

## Steps
1. Understand the feature requirements.
2. Identify where the feature should be implemented (which module/file).
3. Write the implementation following existing code patterns.
4. Write corresponding tests in `tests/`.
5. Run tests to verify the implementation works.
6. Do NOT commit changes unless explicitly requested.

## Output format
- Files modified/created
- Brief description of the implementation
- Test coverage added
